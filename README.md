# In progress, this app will be amazing!

## What will I use in this project?

### Backend

- Postgresql
- Express
- PrismaORM
- Redis
- Express Sessions
- Unit Tests with Jest
- Power of Typescript
- Maybe usage of Firestore or Cloudinary for images if I include it in next versions.

### Frontend (I didn't start it yet)

- NextJS
- Axios
- Power of Typescript
- I will try to do Unit Tests
- Ant Design for style because my css is very bad
- Probably Zustand for state management, I don't want to use Redux again, I even tried Toolkit, wasn't fun that much.
